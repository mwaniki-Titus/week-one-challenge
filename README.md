In marks cade, the user is prompted to input the student's mark.

The code then checks the validity of the input mark using if and else if statements:

If the mark is greater than 100, less than 0, its null
If the mark is greater than 79, the grade is set to 'A'.
If the mark is between 60 and 79 (inclusive), the grade is set to 'B'.
If the mark is between 50 and 59 (inclusive), the grade is set to 'C'.
If the mark is between 40 and 49 (inclusive), the grade is set to 'D'.
If none of the above conditions are met, the grade is set to 'E'.
Finally, the calculated grade is displayed using console.log().
